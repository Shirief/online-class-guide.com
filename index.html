                <div class="resume-section-content">
                    <h2 class="mb-5">Disadvantages</h2>
                    <b>1. Online student feedback is limited</b>
<p>In Online Class/Online Learning system the Instructor or teacher feedback towards the student are limited because most student are dissatisfied with the lack of personal feedback, it may be of the internet or any social media medium not all instructor are willing to give their personal email address  that’s why student have to struggle having a feedback,  while on a face-to-face scenario the instructor give immediate feedback to the student during on a class hours or dedicated office hours.</p>

<b>2. Online Class/E-Learning can cause social Isolation</b>
<p>The Online Class/E-Learning methods may often cause or leads to several mental health issues because of lack of interaction towards other people, because you are learning by yourself and you just facing your screen on many hours, while on face-to-face we are practicing our self for a better interaction towards other to bust our self-esteem and we lest feel anxiety, negative thoughts and heightened stress on interacting with others.</p>

<b>3. Online Class/E-Learning requires strong self-motivation and time management skills</b>
<p>Online Class/E-Learning can be had lack of self-motivation because of the environment of were there live, there are many nuisances in us on place some may not have of does while on the face-to-face scenario there are many things that can keep you motivated like face-to-face communication with other students or communication with your instructor and you have strict schedules that we keep on the track during studies or learning hour. </p>

<b>4. Lack of communicational skill development in online students</b>
<p>Online Class/E-Learning System are lacking of having a face-to-face communication toward other people like your classmate or you Instructor/professor because there are some roles that you need to mute yourself because of our own surroundings have a lot nuisances that’s way we can’t enhance our communication skill, while on a face-to-face scenario we can communicate with help of interaction towards other people.</p>

<b>5. Cheating prevention during online assessments is complicated</b>
<p>Online Class are easy to do some cheating scenario because you are only facing your screen you are alone at a time that no one can caught you while on the face-to-face scenario our Instructor/Professor are guarding us to prevent on doing cheating. </p>

<b>6. Online instructors tend to focus on theory rather than practice</b>
<p>The Online Class system are focusing on theoretical lesson because it’s the only thing available due to lack of interaction with other people that’s the reason why some online class skip any practical activity, while on a face-to-face scenario we can learn more than theoretical lesson because of having an interaction.</p>

<b>7. Online Classes Are Prone to Technical Issues</b>
<p>Some Online Class disadvantages are technical issues some causes of Online class disruption are bad internet connection, a bad audio, bad video interface and some are power outage by these issues student and the Instructor/Professor are the one to need to adjust on these situations, on the other hand face-to-face scenario the only things that are needed are yourself.</p>

<b>8. Online Class/E-Learning is limited to certain disciplines</b>
<p>The Online class/E-Learning system tends to be more suitable with other program like humanities and social science because most of the lesson are theoretically while other programs like medical science, engineering, criminology, are required for a heavy hands-on activity for more experience there no amounts of online class or lecture can substitute an real-life industrial training or an autopsy for medical students and some demo crime scene for criminology student, that’s why all educational discipline are not equal to online class.</p> 

<b>9. Online Class/Online learning is inaccessible to the computer illiterate population</b>
<p>Not all student has their own personal device like smart phone or personal computer like desktop or laptop because some may face financial problem and some may have device of there own but have problem because of old device and bad internet connection specially on rural areas.</p>


<b>10. Lack of accreditation & quality assurance in online education</b>
<p>Some people say the Online class are more effective than a traditional classes because of fast learning system, an easy time management  but there are some online class are unaccredited because all the materials are being checked by instructor/professor themselves as a such poor quality  assurance and lack of accredited of online providers such as university.</p>
